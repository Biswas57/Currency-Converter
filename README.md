# Google Chrome Extension: Currency Converter
Extension made to help convert currencies efficiently and accurately
This was my first ever individual coding project, pretty simple and efficient. Took approximately an hour of working time. 

Idea behind it: Hated the inconvienience when shopping online of having to open a whole new Tab, then search currency converter and then having to choose the currencies, inputing the amounts and THEN FINALLY receiving the output you were looking for. With this simple Chrome extension, all it is a click of a button on your extension bar and then inputting the amount you want to convert and Boom! fastest conversion you've ever experienced.

Posted it on the Chrome Web Store and you can access it using this link:
